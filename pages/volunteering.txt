<h2>Volunteering</h2>

<p>NDSC is entirely run by volunteers, whose time, energy, and commitment make our club what it is today.</p>

<p>We always welcome new volunteers &mdash; whatever your skills, interests, or availability, there&rsquo;s a role for you at Newbury. Typical roles include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Poolside coaching</li>
	<li>Officials</li>
	<li>Committee members</li>
	<li>Admin support</li>
	<li>Fundraising</li>
	<li>Team managers</li>
	<li>Club shop</li>
	<li>Helping during club meets (selling programmes, catering, marshalling, raffle sales, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;d like to help poolside, support at galas, or assist behind the scenes, we&rsquo;d love to hear from you. Every contribution helps our swimmers and strengthens our club community.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to get involved, please use our <a href="https://form.jotform.com/250842556620052">contact form</a>, or speak to any of the <strong>coaches or volunteers</strong> you see around the club.</p>
