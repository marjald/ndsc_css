<h2>Volunteering</h2>

<p>NDSC is entirely run and administered by volunteers. This may mean that there are times when you do not get an immediate response on a question or query. Please bear with us and we will always try to respond quickly.</p>

<p>If you have any queries you can always contact the committee for advice or speak to one of the squad reps, who are normally poolside at most sessions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We always appreciate all offers of help to run our club and new volunteers are always made very welcome. There are many volunteering roles so whatever your skills, interests and availability there will be a role for you at Newbury.</p>

<p>Examples of our volunteer roles include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Poolside coaching</li>
	<li>Officials</li>
	<li>Committee members</li>
	<li>Admin support</li>
	<li>Fundraising</li>
	<li>Team managers</li>
	<li>Club shop</li>
	<li>Helping during club meets (selling programs, providing catering, marshalling or selling raffle tickets etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>There really is a role for everyone, so whether you wish to get involved poolside &ndash; perhaps helping to look after the team at galas or training to be an official - or whether you can help us with fundraising or administration. Whatever way you feel you can help we&#39;d always love to hear from you.</p>

<p>We have a club to be proud of thanks to the volunteers who help run it.</p>

<p>Our Head Coach, Emma Harris, has an incredible passion and drive to see Newbury District Swimming Club grow into an even more successful club, so when you feel able to give us some of your free time, please do so. Your help and support will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>If you would like to get involved with volunteering at the club, please contact our Club Secretary, Jenny Goodman.</p>
