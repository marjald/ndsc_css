  <h2>Introduction to Squads</h2>

  <p>
    The club is run under the squad system, which means that it is divided into
    groups or squads where swimmers train with other swimmers of similar age and
    ability. Swimmers progress through a squad structure that is based upon a
    number of factors including technical skill, age, strength and the ability
    of the swimmer to cope with the training up at the next level.
  </p>

  <p>
    Training times and squad fees vary according to squad so please check the
    timetable tab above.
  </p>

  <p>NDSC swimming is organised into the following squads</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Development</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Academy</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14.4px"
      >Development and Academy are the development squads. The emphasis here is
      on acquiring the basic swimming skills, although many swimmers at this
      level do take part in internal club competitions and novice meets.</span
    >
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Competitive</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14.4px"
      >Competitive, as the name suggests, is the first of the competitive squads
      where the majority of the swimmers are expected to regularly compete in
      competitions. This is reflected in the workload, which is significantly
      more than that experienced in Academy. Sessions consist of a mixture of
      endurance training, stroke technique, drills and start turns skills. Land
      training is introduced in Competitive and must be attended by all
      Competitive Squad members.</span
    >
  </p>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14.4px"
      >Development, Academy and Competitive are usually known collectively as
      the junior squads. Progression through these squads is by acquiring the
      necessary skills and a set of squad entry criteria exists for entry into
      each squad. Parents are more than welcome to discuss squad changes with
      the squad coach.</span
    >
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Advanced Performance</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14.4px"
      >Above Competitive &ndash; in the senior squads &ndash; we have a branched
      squad structure. This system was introduced in order to cater for the fact
      that swimmers at this stage of their career are likely to have varying
      degrees of commitment as well as technical skills. From here on
      progression through the squads depends very much upon commitment and
      enthusiasm as well as ability.</span
    >
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Pathway</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14.4px"
      >For those swimmers who decide that they do not want to commit to the
      rigours of the Advance Performance programme, Pathway squad is the natural
      progression. In general Performance swimmers progress to Advanced
      Performance squad. Likewise some swimmers may move (or be moved!) from
      Advanced Performance to Pathway if the criteria is not maintained.</span
    >
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Masters</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14.4px"
      >Finally we have Masters squad. There are no entry requirements apart from
      the fact that you need to be able to swim, as we are unable to cater for
      non-swimmers within the squad system. Over the years we have entered a
      number of Masters competitions and actually done quite well. All are
      welcome from novice up to top competition level.</span

    Further details on how these squads are organised and the entry criteria for
    each squad can be found on the individual squad pages.
