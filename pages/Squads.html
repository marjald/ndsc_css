  <h2>Introduction to Squads</h2>
  Our club uses a squad system to group swimmers by age and ability, ensuring
  everyone trains effectively with peers. As swimmers develop, they progress
  through our structured system, which considers technical skill, age, strength,
  and readiness for the next level of training. Training times and fees vary by
  squad. Please check the timetable tab above for details. Here&#39;s an
  overview of our squads:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Development</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Academy</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Development and Academy are our foundational squads. The focus here is on
    building core swimming skills. While many swimmers at this stage enjoy
    internal club competitions and novice meets, the primary goal is skill
    acquisition.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Competitive</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Competitive squad is for swimmers who are becoming more serious about
    their sport and are encouraged to participate in competitions consistently.
    Training intensity progresses from the Academy level, with comprehensive
    sessions dedicated to building endurance, honing stroke technique, executing
    drills, and refining start and turn skills. Land training is integrated into
    the schedule and is an essential part of the commitment for Competitive
    Squad members.<br />
    Development, Academy, and Competitive squads are collectively known as our
    Junior Squads. Progression through these squads requires acquiring specific
    skills and meeting squad entry criteria. Feel free to discuss any squad
    changes with your child&#39;s coach.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Performance</h3>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Advanced Performance</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Beyond the junior level, our senior squads feature a branched structure to
    accommodate varying levels of commitment and skill. Progression here
    emphasizes commitment and enthusiasm as much as ability.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Pathway</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For swimmers who prefer a less rigorous commitment than the Performance
    squads, Pathway offers a natural progression, allowing continued training
    without the intense competitive focus. Swimmers may also move between
    Pathway and&nbsp;Performance squads if criteria aren&#39;t maintained.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Masters</h3>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Our Masters squad welcomes adult swimmers of all abilities, from novices to
    top competitors. The only entry requirement is the ability to swim, as we
    cannot accommodate non-swimmers. Our Masters have a history of successful
    competition!<br />
